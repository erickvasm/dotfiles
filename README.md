## Quick install (one command)

Installs git if needed, clones this repo into `~/.dotfiles` (or updates it
if it's already there), and runs the bootstrap script — all in one go:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erickvasm/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"
```

> ⚠️ Use the `/bin/bash -c "$(curl ...)"` form above, **not** `curl ... | bash`.
> That form keeps your terminal attached as an interactive input, so you'll
> actually see (and can answer) password/sudo prompts during the install
> instead of them silently hanging behind the pipe.

Then follow the on-screen instructions. When it's done, check
`~/.dotfiles/install.log` for full details and restart your computer.

## Restore your Dotfiles manually 

1. Install git
2. Clone your dotfiles repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/erickvasm/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
  ```

3. Go to your dotfiles folder:

   ```bash
   cd $HOME/.dotfiles
   ```
4. Give execution permissions to the install script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install/bootstrap.sh
   ```
5. Execute the install script:

   ```bash
   ./install/bootstrap.sh
   ```
6. Execute:

   ```bash
   tail -f install.log
   ```

7. Restart de computer

## Utilities

### `export_config.sh`

This script exports a list of globally installed packages and configurations from various package managers.

**Usage:**

```bash
./utilities/export_config.sh
```

This will create the following files in the `export_logs` directory:

*   `volta_globals.txt`: A list of global tools installed with Volta.
*   `pip_global_packages.txt`: A list of global packages installed with pip.
*   `gradle_properties.txt`: Gradle properties.
*   `Brewfile`: A list of packages installed with Homebrew.

These files can be used to manually update the package lists in `os/unix/python_node.conf` and `os/unix/mac/Brewfile`.

### `plist-config.sh`

This script manages macOS system preferences by exporting and importing configurations using `.plist` files.

**Usage:**

*   **Export:**

    ```bash
    ./utilities/plist-config.sh export
    ```

    This will export your current system preferences to `.plist` files located in `os/unix/mac/settings`.

*   **Import:**

    ```bash
    ./utilities/plist-config.sh import
    ```

    This will import the preferences from the `.plist` files in `os/unix/mac/settings`, applying them to your system.
